The n-Fractions Puzzle

The original fractions puzzle is specified as follows. Find 9 distinct non-zero
digits that satisfy:
A    D    G
-- + -- + -- == 1
BC   EF   HI
where BC is shorthand for 10B+C, EF for 10E+F and HI for 10H+I.
n-Fractions

A simple generalisation is as follows. Find 3n non-zero digits satisfying:
                  x_i
sum_{i in 1 .. n} ------ == 1
                  y_iz_i
where y_iz_i is shorthand for 10y_i+z_i and the number of occurrences of each
digit in 1..9 is between 1 and ceil(n/3).  Since each fraction is at least
1/99, this family of problems has solutions for at most n <= 99. An interesting
problem would be to find the greatest n such that at least one solution exists.
A further generalisation might specify that the fractions sum to ceil(n/3).
